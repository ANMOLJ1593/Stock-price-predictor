# Stock Price Prediction using Time Series Data

Brief Description-

This project aims to predict stock prices using historical time series data. It provides a simple web-based interface where users can select a stock from a dropdown list and automatically fetch relevant data such as Open, High, Low, and Volume prices. The stock prediction model uses machine learning algorithms to forecast future stock prices, helping users make more informed financial decisions. The application is built using Flask for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, along with a stock market API to fetch real-time data.

Features:
Select a stock from a list of popular companies.

Automatically fill in the stock's Open, High, Low, and Volume prices.

Interactive UI with responsive design for mobile and desktop.
